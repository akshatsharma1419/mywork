HTTP/2
   Respond with more data
   Reduce latency by enabling full request and response multiplexing
   Fast, effecient and secure

How does it work?
A single TCP connection can contain multiple requests(Multiplexing)
Each request has a stream id.
It allows compressing.
HTTP/2 with push:
  Make one get request, server send multiple responses for a single request.

  Pros:
    Multiplexing over single connection
    Compression(Header and data)
    Server push
    Secure by default
    Protocol negotiation during TLS (ALPN- application layer protocol negotiation)
  Cons:
     Server push can be abused when configured incorrectly.
     Client might have cached some data, and push event might send lot of unnecessary data
     Need to be careful if load balancers/browser support HTTP2
