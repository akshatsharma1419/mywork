HTTP: 
    Hyper text transfer protocol
    Communication between web servers and clients
    HTTP is stateless, every request is completely independent
    Local storage, cookies, session can be used

    HTTPS- Hyper text transfer protocol secure
    Data sent is encrypted
    SSL/TLS
    Install certificate on web host

    Methods:
    GET- Retrives data from server, or can also be used to send data but it will be appended to url
    POST- Submit data to server
    PUT- Update data already on server, if not present create the resource, whole body is sent in request
    PATCH- Update resource, change only few things which needs to be updated.
    DELETE- delete data from server

    Codes:
    1xx: Request received/processing
    2xx: Successfully received, understood and accepted
    3xx: Further action must be taken/redirect
    4xx: Request does not have what it needs
    5xx: Server failed to fulfil an apparent valid request

How HTTP works:
All requests goes into a TCP connection,
you make a request. You get response. 
TCP connection is busy no new requests can be made
