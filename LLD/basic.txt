For infinite scroll-
We can use sentinel which will be hidden, and will work as a point 
to make call to search for more results.
We create a IntersectionObserver which takes in a callback which is called
when sentinel is reached.

var intersectionObserver = new IntersectionObserver(callbackFn);

Suppose our first API call gives response after second API call
So we can use AbortController here

const controller = new AbortController();

fetch(url,{signal:controller.signal})
controller.abort();

We can add a threshold(0-1) to check if 0-1% of the sentinal is reached
