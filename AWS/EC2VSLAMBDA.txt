1st SQS, 2nd S3, 3rd EC2- Product of AWS

EC2-
Elastic Cloud Computes, 2006. 3rd product of AWS.
   Easy to scale on demand, downscale.
   Create backend services
   We rent EC2, so we pay monthly/yearly

  Process for Auto scaling- Load Balancers -> Target groups -> Auto scaling Groups -> EC2

Lambda- Serverless service
   Less flexibility
   No maintainance
   We can only select memory 128 MB - 2056 MB
   We pay by invocations, duration and memory
We cannot use type of servers we want like in EC2, CPU, GPU.


We can use an API Gateway to point to lambda function, to make it work as an API endpoint
